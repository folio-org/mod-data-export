## Introduction

FOLIO data export module.

#### Important notes

## LIMITATIONS OF THE MODULE
For current releases, the only supported file storage to store the exported MARC files is S3. 
This means that it is expected that AWS credentials are properly configured in a hosting environment as per:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html.
The credential chain looks for the credentials in multiple places and the order of precedence in case it is specified in multiple places is given here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html

## CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED
The module also expects the bucket name to be passed in the JVM as the system parameter with name `bucket.name`

example: java mod-data-export-fat.jar -Dbucket.name=diku_export


## OTHER
In a multi-tenant cluster, each tenant data is stored in it's own folder(prefix) under one bucket. For example, if the tenants are tenant001, tenant002, and bucket name "exportMarc" below is the pattern used stored in the bucket
/{tenantId}/{jobExecutionId}/{fileName}.mrc
- exportMarc/tenant001/448ae575-daec-49c1-8041-d64c8ed8e5b1/testFile-20200116100503.mrc
- exportMarc/tenant002/295e28b4-aea2-4458-9073-385a31e1da05/uc-20200116100503.mrc


Note: There are plans to have hosting agnostic implementation available in 2020 Q2.

## Compiling

```
   mvn install
```

See that it says "BUILD SUCCESS" near the end.

## Docker

Build the docker container with:

```
   docker build -t mod-data-export .
```

Test that it runs with:

```
   docker run -d -t -i -p 8081:8081 mod-data-export
```

## Installing the module

Follow the guide of
[Deploying Modules](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#example-1-deploying-and-using-a-simple-module)
sections of the Okapi Guide and Reference, which describe the process in detail.

## Deploying the module

Next we need to deploy the module. There is a deployment descriptor in
`target/DeploymentDescriptor.json`. It tells Okapi to start the module on 'localhost'.

Deploy it via Okapi discovery:

```
curl -w '\n' -D - -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @target/DeploymentDescriptor.json  \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
```

Then we need to enable the module for the tenant:

```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D -   \
    -H "Content-type: application/json"   \
    -d @target/TenantModuleDescriptor.json \
    http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/<tenant_name>/modules
```

## Issue tracker

at the [FOLIO issue tracker](https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/issue-tracker/).

## Additional information

### Configure your own mapping rules

To configure your own rules, you need to add it to the [mod-configuration module](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-configuration).
"Code" value to use in the request - "RULES_OVERRIDE".
"Value" field represents the rules, create your rules in the proper format(the example of default data-export rules - https://github.com/folio-org/mod-data-export/blob/master/src/main/resources/rules/rulesDefault.json).
Convert the rules to the String format (you can use online [converter](https://tools.knowledgewalls.com/jsontostring)). Put the result string to the "value" field in the request body. 
The description of how to create a configuration in mod-configuration module - https://github.com/folio-org/mod-configuration/blob/master/README.md.
`If there are rules in mod-configuration, and they are enabled, they always will be used for the mapping process for a given tenant.`

## System requirements

Testing was done with a mod-data-export docker image memory limit = 512 MiB.

#### Default mapping profile

For default mapping profile, the max usage of memory is 270 MiB during the process of export 1 million records.
The average memory usage is ~200 MiB.

#### Custom mapping profile with holdings and items
For Custom mapping profile, the max usage of memory is 250 MiB during the process of export 1 million records.
The average memory usage is ~190 MiB.
